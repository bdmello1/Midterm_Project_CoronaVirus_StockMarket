# Stock Market Project 


## Background and Motivation
The recent global health crisis has sent the the world into a frenzy. People are scrambling to stockpile groceries and personal supplies while governments seem to be in peril. The economy has slowed and employment is at its worst in years. As the number of cases increase, more people are admitted to hospitals which stretched the US healthcare system. With an increase in academia supporting the link between public health and economic success, we decided to investigate how the number of deaths associated with COVID-19 affect the stock market. Our results show a clear correlation between increasing deaths and declines in the stock market. Business and economies across the globe are linked to the success of the US stock market and the recent decline has made employers and employees suffer. We analyzed the trend between the rise in deaths and the fall in the market to gain insight into how institutions should anticipate economic responses to the pandemic.

Note: Data through 3/3/2020 was analyzed as the group had already completed the Excel analysis before the deadline was extended.

## US Stock Market Indicies Compared With Global COVID19 Deaths
It was found that there was a direct inverse relationship with the performace of the US stock market comapared to that of the total global death count due to COVID-19. As the amount of COVID-19 cases increases, the US stock makerket as a whole falls. What can be noted is that after day 22 of the active COVID19 virus which marks a total of 2,250 cases golablly marked a threshold point for US markets casusing them to fall consistently with increased cases. 

The market fell for 10 consistent days in this analysis as market fears began to rise with growing COVID19 cases. What begins to happen during day 27 is that there begins to be talks about the FED decresing interest rates to stimulate economic growth which can encourage borrowing and investing. This is where there begins to be a rally for two days as investors think they have a buffer. The market will continue to fall as cases rise becuase stores and business will have to shut down due to the set National Emrgency which can impact indivual slaries utimately not putting money back into the economy (Figure 1).

To battle this, president Trump tries to be reassuring with his tweets and messages saying that there will be stimulus money coming which can help all parts of the business model. Some of his tweets look like Figure 2. Trump does this to build confidence in investors and try to influence the market.

What has been seen in China, the first country with virus, is that as their cases plateaued the volatitly in the market fell as well. Looking at history, there becomes a consolidation period where the market for a few weeks to up to a month decides if it is vlaued at a specific price and utimately moves in that direction. This will only happen as the rate of deaths in the US begins to slow.  The following shows how the US Indexes compare to that of the total Gloabl COVID-19 deaths.

Day 1 refers to 1/22/2020 and Day 29 refers to 3/3/2020. Data on the ETFs DIA, IVV, and IWM were used as these ETFS track the DOW, S&P and Russell 2000 incedes, respectively. 

## Impact of Findings

Impacts on the stock market have wide ranging effects as they impact everyone from hourly workers to seasoned investors. However, the most impacted groups are retirees and those looking to retire soon. For people looking to retire soon, much of their net worth is tied up in investments. As the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths rise, and the stock market falls, their net worth will generally fall as well. This may lead them to push retirement further until they have the money to support themselves without regular income from a job. By staying in their jobs longer, there are fewer empty jobs for others to take, which only furthers the rise in unemployment and economic slowdown.

It is also incredibly important for those who have already retired. Many retirees keep their funds in 401(k), 403(b), and IRA accounts (also other types depending on sector of employment). These accounts are favorable for retirees as they have tax advantages. Once money is put into these accounts, it cannot be withdrawn without penalty until age 65. After 71.5, people are required to withdraw money in what are called "required minimum distributions" (RMDs), which are set percentages of account value that must be withdrawn each year. Even if the stock market is lower than it has been in years, these retirees must withdraw their money. They do not have the option to hold or to wait until the market improves. As such, not only does COVID-19 affect the elderly most dramatically health-wise, but it also has huge effects on their financial outlook and success given the inverse relationship between COVID-19 deaths and the market.


## Recommendations 

### Short-term Recommendations 
Political action to suspend RMDs until the economy stabilizes. This will allow retirees to mitgate the negative effects of the recent decline of the economy on their portfolio. Retirees will not have to pull money out of the market becuase if they do, they might run into finacial barriers later in their retirement. 


### Long-term Recommendations
Encourage younger generations to incorporate transitions into their portfolio to decrease theit risk so that they have a continued buffer during major economic decline. This would move assets away from equity, a risky investment, to safer options such as bonds and fixed income. This would be gradual so that by the time they reach retirement, most of their net worth would be in less risky options and they would be less susceptible to the swings in the market.
